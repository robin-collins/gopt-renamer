	// Add your dependencies here, for example:

)
<FINAL_CODE>

You will need to replace `example.com/your_project` with your actual module path. Also, you should add any dependencies that your project requires under the `require` block. For instance, if you're using a specific package for making HTTP requests or for encoding/decoding JSON, you should list them there with their versions.

After you've created your `go.mod` file with the above content, you can run `go mod tidy` in your project directory to automatically download the dependencies and populate the `go.mod` file with the correct versions.
